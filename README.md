# THAT'S MY JAM! 

Search through a database by using song title and artist name to return a youtube video of the song along with biography.

Motivation for development of this application comes from the desire to easily access information about new music the user discovers.

As a music lover 
I want a database of artistsâ€™ biographies
So that I can expand my knowledge of the music I love and hear the song on the spot.
